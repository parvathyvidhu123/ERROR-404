📝 Project Description

Glitch Café is a fun and interactive cyberpunk-inspired café menu website. ✨ It features a glitchy neon header, animated floating hero image 🖼, and interactive menu cards 📋 that allow users to "order" items with a toast notification 🍽 and visual effects. The design uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external frameworks ⚡ — making it lightweight and fast-loading 🚀.
